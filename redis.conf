# By default Redis does not run as a daemon. Use 'yes' if you need it.
# Note that Redis will write a pid file in /usr/local/var/run/redis.pid when daemonized.
daemonize yes

# If a pid file is specified, Redis writes it where specified at startup
# and removes it at exit.
#
# When the server runs non daemonized, no pid file is created if none is
# specified in the configuration. When the server is daemonized, the pid file
# is used even if not specified, defaulting to "/usr/local/var/run/redis.pid".
#
# Creating a pid file is best effort: if Redis is not able to create it
# nothing bad happens, the server will start and run normally.
