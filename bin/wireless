# Signal (a.k.a. RSSI) is the usable strength of the radio waves, expressed
# in decibels between 0db (strongest) and -120db (weakest). Smaller negative
# numbers represent a cleaner/stronger signal. For wireless data
# communications, normal range is -45db to -87db. Anything below -85db
# is generally unusable, and over -50db can be considered perfect.
#
# Noise (dBm) in wireless communications is a combination of all unwanted
# interfering signal sources, such as crosstalk, radio frequency interference,
# distortion, etc. This value is measured in decibels from zero to -120.
# The closer this value is to -120, the better, because that means there is
# little to no interference. Typical environments range between -100db
# and -80db.
